  rs:solution        [ rs:binding  [ rs:value     "Paris-Orly Air Base was located at Aeroport de Paris-Orly, nine miles (15 km) south of Paris, France off Autoroute A6/A10m with a highway exit directly into the base. Orly Air Base was developed after World War II when Orly Airport was used as a combat Advanced Landing Ground, designated as \"A-47\" by US Army Air Force's Ninth Air Force. Rebuilt after the war as a joint civilian airport/NATO facility, the primary use of Orly Air Base was to meet the needs of personnel supporting Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) at Rocquencourt, with secondary functions as a personnel processing center for inbound and outbound personnel assigned to France and as a limited operational transport base. The USAF facilities at Orly were turned over to the French government in 1967 as a result of France's withdrawal from NATO's integrated military command, and all non-French NATO forces were asked to leave France."@en ;

  rs:solution        [ rs:binding  [ rs:value     "Stade Chaban-Delmas is a sporting stadium located in the city of Bordeaux, France. It is the home ground of FC Girondins de Bordeaux. Until 2001, the stadium's name was the Stade du Parc Lescure. That year it was renamed after politician Jacques Chaban-Delmas, who was the mayor of Bordeaux from 1947 to 1995. First built in 1930 as a cycle-racing track, in 1935 it was reconfigured to accommodate the upcoming 1938 Football World Cup. It was the first stadium in the world to have stands entirely covered without any pillars obstructing visibility of the playing area. Classified as a historic building, its restoration has been difficult, as its roof does not cover seats built after 1984 on the old cycle track. The current seating capacity of the stadium is 34,462, following various work of seating to the stands, in particular for the 1998 FIFA World Cup. A record 40,211 spectators were in attendance on 24 April 1985 to watch a match between Girondins de Bordeaux and Juventus. In preparation of several matches that were held here for the 2007 Rugby World Cup, two giant television screens measuring 37 mÂ² were installed. The tunnel connecting the locker rooms of the players to the ground is the longest in Europe (close to 120 meters)."@en ;
