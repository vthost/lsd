            rs:binding  [ rs:value     "Daisy wheel printers use an impact printing technology invented in 1969 by David S. Lee at Diablo Data Systems. It uses interchangeable pre-formed type elements, each with typically 96 glyphs, to generate high-quality output comparable to premium typewriters such as the IBM \"Golfball\" Selectric, but three times faster. Daisy-wheel printing was used in electronic typewriters, word processors and computer systems from 1972. By 1980 daisy-wheel printers had become the dominant technology for high-quality print. Dot-matrix impact or thermal printers were used where higher speed was required and poor print quality was acceptable. Both technologies were rapidly superseded for most purposes when dot-based printers&mdash;in particular laser printers&mdash;that could print any characters or graphics rather than being restricted to a limited character set became able to produce output of comparable quality. Daisy-wheel technology is now found only in some electronic typewriters."@en ;
