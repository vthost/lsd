        rdfs:comment  "Russell Brand's Ponderland is a BAFTA nominated comedy on the British television station Channel 4, presented by comedian and actor Russell Brand. The show consists largely of Brand giving a series of monologues in a stand-up style, interspersed with old television and video footage. Brand has said there will be no more Ponderland as he is focusing on making films."@en ;
