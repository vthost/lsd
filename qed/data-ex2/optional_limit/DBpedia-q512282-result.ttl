            rs:binding  [ rs:value     "Bruttia Crispina (164-182 or 187) was the Empress of Rome and wife of Roman Emperor Commodus. Crispina’s mother is unknown and her father was twice consul Gaius Bruttius Praesens. Crispina’s paternal grandparents were consul and senator Caius Bruttius Praesens and rich heiress Laberia Hostilia Crispina, who was the daughter of another twice consul, Manius Laberius Maximus. Crispina's brother was future consul Lucius Bruttius Quintius Crispinus. Her father’s family originally came from Volceii, Lucania, Italy and were closely associated with the Roman Emperors Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius. Crispina was born and raised in Rome or Volceii. Crispina married Commodus, in the summer of 178 (probably July). The actual ceremony was modest but it was commemorated on coinage and largesse was distributed to the people. An epithalamium for the occasion was composed by the sophist Julius Pollux. Like many marriages of young members of the upper orders, it was an arranged marriage: Crispina's father and Marcus Aurelius (Commodus’ father) had arranged for it to occur. Commodus disliked Crispina, presumably due to her character - she was a beautiful woman, but said to be vain and haughty. She received the title of Augusta. In 182, Crispina may have been pregnant. She was accused of adultery or treason by her husband and exiled to the island of Capri where she was executed. Her fall is sometimes associated with the conspiracy of Lucilla in 181 or 182. This is consistent with the coinage at Alexandria, where her coinage runs from 178/9 only to 182/3 or 181/2. Alternatively, her fall may have taken place after 187."@en ;
