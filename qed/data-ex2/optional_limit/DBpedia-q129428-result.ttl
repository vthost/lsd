He was the son of Alfred the Great but had to fight his cousin, Aethelwold, to become King. He fought many battles during his time as King. Most of them were to expand his territory and to stop other groups of people becoming more powerful. He was killed in battle in 924. After his death the Kingdom of England was divided between Ã†lfweard and Athelstan."@en ;
