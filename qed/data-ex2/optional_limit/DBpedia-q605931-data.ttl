        ns0:abstract    "Edward the Confessor (c. 1003 &ndash; 5 January 1066), son of Æthelred the Unready and Emma of Normandy, was one of the last Anglo-Saxon kings of England and is usually regarded as the last king of the House of Wessex, ruling from 1042 to 1066 (technically the last being Edgar the Ætheling who was proclaimed king briefly in late 1066, but was deposed after about eight weeks. ) His reign marked the continuing disintegration of royal power in England and the advancement in power of the earls. It foreshadowed the country's domination by the Normans, whose Duke William of Normandy was to defeat Edward's successor, Harold II, and seize the crown. Edward had succeeded Cnut's son Harthacnut, restoring the rule of the House of Wessex after the period of Danish rule since Cnut had conquered England in 1016. When Edward died in 1066 he had no son to take over the throne so a conflict arose as three men claimed the throne of England. Edward was canonized in 1161 by Pope Alexander III, and is commemorated on 13 October by the Roman Catholic Church, the Church of England and other Anglican Churches. He is regarded as the patron saint of kings, difficult marriages, and separated spouses. From the reign of Henry II of England to 1348 he was considered to be the patron saint of England, when he was replaced in this role by Saint George, and he has remained the patron saint of the Royal Family."@en , "Eduard die Belyer was een van die laaste Angel-Saksiese konings van Engeland. Hy het sy halfbroer Hartaknoet opgevolg en het van 8 Junie 1042 tot op 4 Januarie 1066 regeer. Hy word in die algemeen beskou as die laaste koning van die Huis van Wessex. Die laaste monarg is eintlik Edgar die Adeling, wat in 1066 vir ’n kort rukkie as koning uitgeroep is. Hy is egter nooit gekroon nie en het net sowat agt weke regeer."@af ;
