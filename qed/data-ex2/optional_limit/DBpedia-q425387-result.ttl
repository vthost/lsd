            rs:binding  [ rs:value     "Egnatia Mariniana probably was the wife of Roman Emperor Valerian and mother of Emperor Gallienus and Valerianus Minor. Several coins bearing the legend date back to the beginning of the reign of Valerian and Gallienus. Given the use of deifying the wife's dead before their husbands' accession to the throne, it is possible Mariniana died before 253. It is possible that Egnatius Victor Marinianus, Legatus of Arabia Petraea and Moesia Superior, was the father of Mariniana. If this is true, Mariniana is also the mother of Gallienus, whose name was Publius Licinius Egnatius Gallienus. Other sources, however, make her the daughter of Lucius Egnatius Victor and sister of Lucius Egnatius Victor Lollianus, which makes him her uncle or perhaps brother. This is sustained by the fact that her great-great-great-great-great-nephew was named Flavius Avitus Marinianus."@en ;
