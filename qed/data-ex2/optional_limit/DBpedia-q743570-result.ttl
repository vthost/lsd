In 273, he was raised to the rank of Caesar, with the title of princeps iuventutis, and in January 274 he started his first consulship, together with his father. After the defeat and deposition of his father in the autumn of 274, he appeared as a prisoner in Aurelian's triumph, but the emperor spared their lives. According to some sources, he even kept his senatorial rank."@en ;
