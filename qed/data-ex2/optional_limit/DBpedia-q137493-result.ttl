            rs:binding  [ rs:value     "Alfred the Great, was King of Wessex from 871 to 899. Alfred is noted for his defence of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of southern England against the Vikings, becoming the only English king to be accorded the epithet \"the Great\". Alfred was the first King of the West Saxons to style himself \"King of the Anglo-Saxons\". Details of his life are described in a work by the Welsh scholar and bishop, Asser. Alfred was a learned man who encouraged education and improved his kingdom's legal system and military structure. Alfred is a Catholic and an Eastern Orthodox Church saint and is commonly regarded as a hero of the Christian Church in the Anglican Communion, with a feast day of 26 October."@en ;
