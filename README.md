# SPARQL QED

SPAQRL QED is a system generating out-of-the-box datasets for SPARQL queries over linked data. It distinguishes the queries according to the different SPARQL features and creates, for each query, a small but exhaustive dataset comprising linked data and the query answers over this data. We ensure that the created datasets are diverse and cover various practical use cases and, of course, that the sets of answers included are the correct ones.
