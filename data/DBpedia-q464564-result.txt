        <literal xml:lang="en">Carry On Behind is the 27th in the series of Carry On films to be made, and was released in 1975. It was the first not to be scripted by Talbot Rothwell since Carry On Cruising 13 years previously. Also missing was series stalwart Sid James. James was busy touring in a play whilst Rothwell's health prevented him from writing. The regular actors present are Kenneth Williams, Kenneth Connor, Jack Douglas, Joan Sims and Peter Butterworth. Carry On Behind was the final picture in the series for Bernard Bresslaw (in his 14th appearance) and Patsy Rowlands (in her ninth appearance). This was Elke Sommer's only appearance in a Carry On and the first of two entries in the series for Windsor Davies.</literal>
