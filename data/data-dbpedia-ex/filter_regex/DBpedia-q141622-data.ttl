        ns4:abstract  "Benjamin Franklin was one of the \"Founding Fathers\" of the United States, and one of the country's earliest politicians. He had a very important part in shaping the American Revolution, even though he was never elected to any official position. As a leader of the Enlightenment, he influenced European scientists. He even was the first thing many Europeans associated with America at the time. His success with the French military was an important factor in America's win over Great Britain. Most people see Franklin as one of history's greatest inventors. Some of his greatest creations include the lightning rod, bifocals (a type of eyeglasses), the idea of unity in the Thirteen Colonies, and the idea of America itself. The city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (where he lived) marked his three hundredth birthday in 2006. Franklin is frequently seen on the United States' hundred-dollar bill as a mark of brilliance and a tribute to its past."@en , "Benjamin Franklin (January 17, 1706 &ndash; April 17, 1790) was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States of America. A noted polymath, Franklin was a leading author and printer, satirist, political theorist, politician, scientist, inventor, civic activist, statesman, soldier, and diplomat. As a scientist, he was a major figure in the Enlightenment and the history of physics for his discoveries and theories regarding electricity. He invented the lightning rod, bifocals, the Franklin stove, a carriage odometer, and the glass 'armonica'. He formed both the first public lending library in America and the first fire department in Pennsylvania. He was an early proponent of colonial unity, and as a political writer and activist, he supported the idea of an American nation. As a diplomat during the American Revolution, he secured the French alliance that helped to make independence of the United States possible. Franklin is credited as being foundational to the roots of American values and character, a marriage of the practical and democratic Puritan values of thrift, hard work, education, community spirit, self-governing institutions, and opposition to authoritarianism both political and religious, with the scientific and tolerant values of the Enlightenment. In the words of Henry Steele Commager, \"In Franklin could be merged the virtues of Puritanism without its defects, the illumination of the Enlightenment without its heat. \" To Walter Isaacson, this makes Franklin, \"the most accomplished American of his age and the most influential in inventing the type of society America would become. \" Franklin became a newspaper editor, printer, and merchant in Philadelphia, becoming very wealthy writing and publishing Poor Richard's Almanack and The Pennsylvania Gazette. Franklin was interested in science and technology, and gained international renown for his famous experiments. He played a major role in establishing the University of Pennsylvania and was elected the first president of the American Philosophical Society. Franklin became a national hero in America when he spearheaded the effort to have Parliament repeal the unpopular Stamp Act. An accomplished diplomat, he was widely admired among the French as American minister to Paris and was a major figure in the development of positive Franco-American relations. From 1775 to 1776, Franklin was the Postmaster General under the Continental Congress and from 1785 to 1788, the President of the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania. Toward the end of his life, he became one of the most prominent abolitionists. His colorful life and legacy of scientific and political achievement, and status as one of America's most influential Founding Fathers, have seen Franklin honored on coinage and money; warships; the names of many towns, counties, educational institutions, namesakes, and companies; and more than two centuries after his death, countless cultural references."@en .

V roce 1907 obdržel Nobelovu cenu za fyziku za své přesné optické přístroje a výzkum prováděný pomocí nich."@cs , "Albert Abraham MICHELSON estis germandevena usona fizikisto. Li enkondukis kiel baza konstanto la lumrapidon kaj okupiĝis pri spektroskopiaj kaj meteorologiaj esploroj. Li ricevis en 1907 Nobel-premion pri fiziko. Michelson estis 2-jara, kiam kun la familio elmigris al Usono. La familio komence loĝis en Novjorko, poste translokiĝis al la nevada Virginia City, pli poste al San Francisco, kie la patro iĝis bonhava komercisto. Michelson iĝis en aĝo de 17 jaroj membro de la Usona Marista Akademio en Annapolis (Maryland). Li atingis bonajn rezultojn en la natursciencoj, sed la rezulto en maristaj lernobjektoj estis sub averaĝa nivelo. Li finstudis en 1873, poste lernis de 1875 ĝis 1879 natursciencojn en la Akademio. Li komencis okupiĝis en 1878 pri precita mezurado de la lumrapido, tio iĝis lia vivpasio. Li mezuris per hejme fabrikitaj iloj, sed li volis pli precizajn valorojn, tiel li komencis lerni optikon en Eŭropo (1880). Post kiam li plenigis du jarojn en Berlino, Heidelberg kaj Parizo, li forlasis en 1881 la mararmeon. Hejmenveturante en la Usonon, li mezuris la lumrapidon kaj konstatis la valoron de 299 853 km/s, kiu valoro estis la plej bona dateno dum jardekoj. La rapidon pliprecizigis poste Michelson mem. Michelson komencis konstrui interferometron ankoraŭ en Eŭropo, kiu duonigas lumfaskon, kies du partoj poste iras paralele kaj poste denove unuiĝas. Se la lumfaskoj perdas la ritmon, tiam estiĝas alterne helaj kaj malhelaj interferaj strioj. La larĝo kaj nombro de la strioj ebligas pli precizajn mezurojn per komparo de la du lumfaskoj. Michelson volis mezuri per interferometro la relativan rapidon de la Tero al la etero, oni pensis tim, ke la etero plenigas la universon. La la eksperimentoj de Michelson en Berlin ne montris striojn, tiel la Tero ne moviĝas rilate al la etero. Michelson ekde 1883 laboris kiel profesoro pri fiziko en la Altlernejo de Aplikata Naturscienco Case en Cleveland kaj eksperimentis pri interferometro. Li volis publikigi la rezultojn jam en 1887, kiuj ne montris interferometrajn striojn. Li laboris kun usona kemiisto Edward William Morley, post ili nomumiĝas nun la Michelson–Morley-eksperimento. Inter la newton-a fiziko, la rezultoj estis kontraŭdiraj, kiujn solvis nur relativeca teorio de Albert Einstein en 1905. Michelson estis ekde 1892 fizika profesoro en Worcester, en Universitato Clark, ekde 1889 fizika profesoro de la Ĉikaga Universitato kaj samtempe gvidanto de la fizika katedro. Li retiriĝis en 1929. Li estis de 1923 ĝis 1927 prezidanto de la Nacia Scienca Akademio. Li estis la unua usonano, kiu ricevis Nobel-premion (en 1907 pro la spektroskopiaj kaj meteologiaj esploroj). Michelson proponis, ke oni uzu lumon kun difinita ondolongo por mezuri distancon. Lia interferometro ebligis mezuron de la planetoj, li mezuris la interferometrajn striojn de la lumoj, alvenantaj el la du flankoj de la planedo. Li almuntis en 1920 sesmetran interferometron al la 244 cm-a teleskopo, tiel sukcesis mezuri diametron de la Betelgeuse-stelo. Li ricevis la valoron de 386.160.000 km, 300-obla diametro ol tiu de la Suno. Tio estis la unua fakte preciza stel-mezurado. Li difinis en la kaliforniaj montoj je precizeco de 2,5 cm distancon de du montoj, situantaj 35 km unu de la alia. Michelson en 1923 reiris al la problemo de la lumrapida mezurado. Li uzis specifan, okflankan, turnantan spegulon kaj mezuris lumrapidon de 299 798 km/s. Li plifajnigis la mezuradon uzante longan vakuan tubon, en kiu moviĝis la lumo tien-reen ĝis postlasis 16 en la vakuo. Michelson mortis antaŭ ol analizi rezultojn de la lasta mezuro. Oni publikigis en 1933 la finan rezulton: 299 774 km/s. Tio estas iom 2 km/s pli granda ol la valoro akceptita en la 1970-aj jaroj."@eo , "Albert Abraham Michelson (1852 til 1931) esis Usana fizikisto qua recevis Nobel-premio en fiziko ye 1907."@io , "Albert Abraham Michelson, né à Strzelno le 19 décembre 1852 et mort à Pasadena le 9 mai 1931, est un physicien américain d'origine allemande, prix Nobel de physique en 1907."@fr , "Albert Abraham Michelson, američki fizičar poljskog porijekla 1907. - Nobelova nagrada za fiziku"@hr , "Albertus Abraham Michelson fuit physicus Americanus oriundus e Germania.

Filho de um casal de comerciantes judeus. Aos dois anos de idade, emigra, com os pais Samuel e Rosalie, para os EUA, estabeleceram-se inicialmente em Nova Yorque, posteriormente, migraram para Murphy’s Camp (Califórnia) e Virginia City (Nevada) seguindo os ciclos do ouro e da prata. Em Virginia City, abriram uma pequena loja que se expandiu anos depois quando retornaram à Califórnia na cidade de São Francisco. Michelson cresceu em meio à expansão destas cidades mineradoras, estudou em escolas públicas, concluindo os estudos secundários na High School de São Francisco em 1869. Na época a família de Michelson não tinha condições financeiras para levar os estudos do filho adiante, por isso, aos 17 anos, ele candidatou-se para o exame de seleção na Academia Naval de Annapolis, apesar dos exames favoráveis e muitas cartas de recomendações, não foi aprovado. A persistência, uma das características marcantes de sua vida, o levou a Washington onde acabou encontrando casualmente o então Presidente Grant. A sua habilidade e poder de convencimento, junto a vários pontos de conveniência política impressionaram o presidente que endereçou uma carta a Academia Naval criando uma vaga extra para Michelson. Na academia, sua formação foi a tradicional, concluindo seus estudos em 1873 com destaque em ciências e abaixo da média em navegação. Após a formatura, passou dois anos no mar, sendo nomeado, em 1875, instrutor de química e física da Academia Naval de Annapolis, cargo que ocupou até 1879. No mesmo ano, casou-se com Margaret McLean Hemingway, filha de uma tradicional família de escritores, com quem teve um filho e três filhas, porém seu casamento se torna conturbado e nove anos depois ele casa-se novamente com Edna Stanton. Em 1877, assiste a uma palestra de Jean Bernard Foucault sobre métodos para determinar a velocidade da luz, acontecimento que marca sua vida. Sentindo necessidade de melhorar o método de Foucault começa a estudar óptica e passa a se dedicar à paixão de sua vida: a medição precisa da velocidade da luz. No ano de 1878, com o financiamento do sogro, desenvolve seu projeto encontrando o valor de 300152 km/s para velocidade da luz, superando Foucault. Em 1879, licencia-se da Marinha Americana e viaja com a esposa e os filhos para a Europa passando dois anos em Berlim, Heidelberg e Paris concluindo seu doutorado. No final do século XIX, a comunidade científica da época considerava a física uma ciência praticamente pronta, havia apenas algumas arestas que logo seriam aparadas, entre estas arestas estava a propagação da luz que ainda não tinha uma explicação satisfatória. A teoria de luz ondulatória estava em alta na época levando a crer que a luz se propagaria em um fluido de propriedades únicas chamado éter luminífero Em suas viagens a Paris, Michelson conhece Mascart e Cornu que o incentivaram na construção de seu interferômetro (com fundos de Alexander Graham Bell) com a finalidade de detectar o éter luminífero. Depois de muitas tentativas com o auxílio do químico Edward Williams Morley, não conseguiram detectar através da luz nenhum movimento da terra em relação ao éter. Michelson sempre considerou que seus testes e resultados foram um fracasso, mesmo no final da vida ele não conseguia acreditar que a luz não fosse uma onda se propagando no éter. Michelson foi o primeiro cientista americano a receber o Nobel de Física, em 1907, por suas contribuições no estudo da luz. Suas descobertas causaram grande agitação nos meios científicos da época. Novas teorias começaram a ser desenvolvidas para explicar os fenômenos ópticos, agora, porém, abandonando o éter; terminaria pela formulação da teoria relativística (Albert Einstein), iniciando uma nova era para a física. Em 1929, sai da Universidade de Chicago e passa a trabalhar no Observatório Mont Wilson na Pasadena, local onde veio a falecer em 9 de maio de 1931, deixando alguns trabalhos inacabados. Principais obras: Velocidade da Luz (1902) e Estudos em Óptica (1927)."@pt , "Albert Abraham Michelson se yon fizisyen ameriken, nan peyi Etazini .

Doğumundan iki yıl sonra ailesi Virginia City'ye taşındı. Fakat daha sonra San Francisco'ya gittiler. Michelson burada 1869 yılında liseyi bitirdi. Başkan Grant tarafından U.S. Naval Academy (Denizcilik yüksekokulu) 'ye çağrıldı. Teğmen olarak mezun olduktan sonra iki yıl gemiyle gezdi. Daha sonra Amiral Sampson'un yanında akademide fizik ve kimya öğretmenliği yaptı. 1879'da Denizcilik almanak ofisinde çalıştı. Avrupa'ya gitti, orada Berlin Üniversitesi, Heidelberg, ve Paris'teki College de France and École Polytechnique okullarını ziyaret etti. 1883 'de deniz kuvvetlerinden istifa etti. Cleveland, Ohio' da uygulama okulu fizik profesörü oldu. 1890' da Clark University' Worcester, Massachusetts de aynı pozisyondaki görevi kabul etti. Ve 1892'de yeni kurulan Chicago Üniversite'sinde fizik profesörü ve bölüm başkanı oldu. I. dünya savaşı sırasında Deniz kuvvetlerine tekrar katıldı. 1918'de Chicago'ya geri döndü. Michelson, 1929 yılında Mount Wilson Observatory' de çalışmak üzere istifa etti. Kariyeri boyunca fiziğin çeşitli dallarıyla ilgilendi. Onun özel bir yeteneği olduğu anlaşılan optikte başarı sağladı. Işığın hızını ilk olarak 1881 'de inanılmaz bir duyarlılıkla ölçtü. Dünyanın hareketinin, ışık hızının ölçümündeki etkisini ölçen interferometre'yi keşfetti. Profesör E. W. Morley' le birlikte interferometre'yi kullanarak ışığın bütün dahili sistemlerde aynı hızda ilerlediğini gösterdi. İnterferometre ayrıca istenilen mesafeyi dalgaboyu cinsinden büyük bir duyarlılıkla ölçmek içinde kullanılıyordu. Uluslararası ağırlık ve ölçü birimleri komitesinin isteği üzerine standart metreyi Kadmiyum ışığının dalgaboyu cinsinden ölçtü. Echelon spectroscope'unu buldu ve savaş yıllarında deniz kuvvetlerindeki çalışmalarıyla burası için aletler geliştirdi. U.S. deniz kuvvetleri araç gereçleri arasında yer alan mesafe ölçeri(Rangefinder) bunlardan biridir. Sivil yaşama döndüğünde daha çok astronomi ile ilgilendi. 1920'de ışık girişimini kullanarak ve interferometre'nin gelişmiş şekliyle, Betelgeuse yıldızının çapını ölçtü. Bu ölçüm aynı zamanda ilk defa bir yıldızın büyüklüğünün doğru olarak tesbitidir. Michelson'un birçok bilimsel dergide yazıları yayımlandı. Bunlardan bazıları Velocity of Light (1902) Light Waves and their Uses (1899-1903), ve Studies in Optics'(1927)dir. Michelson Amerika ve on Avrupa ülkesinde birçok etkili topluluğa üye olmuştur. O American Physical Society (1900) 'nin, American Association for the Advancement of Science (1910-1911)'ın, ve National Academy of Sciences (1923-1927) 'ın başkanlığınıda yaptı. Ayrıca Royal Astronomical Society, the Royal Society of London ve the Optical Society, an Associate of l'Académie Française'ninde bir üyesiydi.

Wansink is best known for his work on consumer behavior and food and for popularizing terms such as \"mindless eating\" and \"health halos. \" His research has focused on how our immediate environment (supermarkets, packaging, homes, pantries, and tablescapes) influences eating habits and preferences. Wansink holds the John S. Dyson Endowed Chair in the Applied Economics and Management Department at Cornell University. He is the author of over 100 academic articles and books, including the best-selling book Mindless Eating: Why We Eat More Than We Think and Marketing Nutrition (2005) . He is a 2007 recipient of the humorous Ig Nobel Prize and was named ABC World News Person of the Week on January 4, 2008. Having been referred to as the \"Sherlock Holmes of Food\" and the \"Wizard of Why\" Wansink and his Food and Brand Lab have been credited with improving the deeper scientific understanding of food eating and food shopping. A fundamental finding is that our environment—such as the way a food is labeled, presented, stored, or served—biases our eating habits and taste preferences. A large part of eating less and eating better, he argues, involves making small changes to our homes and to the daily \"mindless\" patterns of our lives. In underscoring this, the first and last sentence of his book, Mindless Eating states, \"The best diet is the one you don't know you're on. \" The studies from the lab have been credited with the development of the 100 calorie packs and the Small Plate Movement as well as discovering and quantifying a wide range of basic, every day insights: Moving from a 12-inch to a 10-inch dinner plate leads people to serve and eat 22% less. A person will eat an average of 92% of any food they serve themselves. The average person makes an excess of 250 decisions about food each day. Low-fat labels lead people to eat 16-23% more total calories. The Nutritional Gatekeeper of a home influences an estimated 72% of all of the food their family eats. Because of visual illusions, people (even Philly bartenders) pour 28% more into a short wide glasses than tall ones. 50% of the snack food bought in bulk (such as at a warehouse club store) is eaten within six days of purchase."@en .

He received his medical education at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of the Western District of New York in Fairfield, New York. In 1833, he moved to Apalachicola, Florida, a port city on the Gulf coast. As well as being resident physician at two hospitals, Gorrie was active in the community. At various times he served as a council member, Postmaster, President of the Bank of Pensacola's Apalachicola Branch, Secretary of the Masonic Lodge, and was one of the founding vestrymen of Trinity Episcopal Church. Dr. Gorrie's medical research involved the study of tropical diseases. At the time the theory that bad air caused diseases was a prevalent hypothesis and based on this theory, he urged draining the swamps and the cooling of sickrooms. For this he cooled rooms with ice in a basin suspended from the ceiling. Cool air, being heavier, flowed down across the patient and through an opening near the floor. Since ice had to be brought by boat from the northern lakes, Gorrie experimented with making artificial ice. After 1845, he gave up his medical practice to pursue refrigeration projects. On May 6, 1851, Gorrie was granted Patent No. 8080 for a machine to make ice. The original model of this machine and the scientific articles he wrote are at the Smithsonian Institution. Impoverished, Gorrie sought to raise money to manufacture his machine, but the venture failed when his partner died. Humiliated by criticism, financially ruined, and his health broken, Gorrie died in seclusion on June 29, 1855. He is buried in Gorrie Square in Apalachicola."@en .

Severo Ochoą w 1959 Nagrodę Nobla z dziedziny medycyny za odkrycie sposobu w jaki cząsteczki kwasu dezoksyrybonukleinowego są reprodukowane w komórkach bakteryjnych i za odtworzenie (rekonstrukcję) go w warunkach laboratoryjnych. Arthur Kornberg urodził się w Nowym Jorku jako syn Josepha i Leny Kornbergów. Jego rodzice byli emigrantami z Galicji i przybyli do Stanów Zjednoczonych w 1900. Ojciec pracował jako operator maszyny do szycia przez ponad 30 lat a później gdy podupadł na zdrowiu otworzył mały sklep z narzędziami, w którym pomagał mu mały Arthur. Joseph Kornberg mimo braku formalnego wykształcenia władał sześcioma językami. Arthur Kornberg kształcił się najpierw w Abraham Lincoln High School a następnie w nowojorskim college'u. W 1937 uzyskał pierwszy stopień naukowy – Bachelor of Science. W 1941 na Uniwersytecie w Rochester został doktorem medycyny. W latach 1942-53 Kornberg kierował pracami badawczymi w Amerykańskim Narodowym Instytucie Zdrowia, dotyczyły one enzymów oraz procesu metabolizmu. Dzięki jego pomocy udało się też odkryć reakcje chemiczne zachodzące w komórkach, w wyniku których dochodzi do powstania dinukleotydu flawinoadeninowego oraz nukleotydu dwufosfopirydynowego. Przyczynił się także do poznania procesu tworzenia koenzymów istotnych przy przenoszeniu wodoru w biologicznych procesach utleniania i redukcji. Pracował także w latach 1953-59 jako dyrektor instytutu mikrobiologii na uniwersytetach w Waszyngtonie i Saint Louis. W dalszym ciągu kontynuował swoje badania dotyczące sposobu wytwarzania przez organizmy żywe nukleotydów. Szczególnym obszarem jego zainteresowań był problem dotyczący wiązań łączących nukleotydy i formowania w ten sposób cząsteczek DNA. Rozwiązał tę kwestię poprzez dodanie specjalnie oznakowanych nukleotydów (poprzez potraktowanie ich radioaktywnym izotopem azotu) do wyciągu z kultur zwykłych bakterii Escherichia coli. Model tej replikacji jest nazywany replikacją semikonserwatywną. W trakcie tego doświadczenia w 1956 r. znalazł dowody na przebieganie reakcji polimeryzacji z udziałem enzymów jako katalizatorów. Wówczas też wyodrębnił \"czysty\" enzym za którego pomocą w połączeniu z pewnymi grupami nukleotydów był w stanie stworzyć dokładne kopie krótkich łańcuchów cząsteczek DNA. Od 1959 Kornberg był profesorem biochemii na Uniwersytecie Stanford w Palo Alto w Kalifornii. Jest ojcem Rogera Kornberga który w 2006 otrzymał Nagrodę Nobla w dziedzinie chemii w 2006 \"za badania molekularnego mechanizmu transkrypcji w komórkach eukariotycznych.\""@pl , "Arthur Kornberg oli yhdysvaltalainen biokemisti. Hän sai vuonna 1959 yhdessä Severo Ochoan kanssa Nobelin lääketieteen palkinnon tutkimuksistaan DNA-synteesin alalla. Kornberg syntyi New Yorkissa, johon hänen vanhempansa Joseph ja Lena olivat muuttaneet Galitsiasta. Hän opiskeli ensin Abraham Lincoln High Schoolissa ja sitten City Collegessa, josta hän valmistui vuonna 1937, sekä Rochesterin yliopistolla, josta hän sai lääketieteen tohtorin arvon vuonna 1941. Kornbergilla oli kohonnut veren bilirubiinitaso eli Gilbertin oireyhtymä, joka aiheuttaa lievää keltaisuutta iholla. Lääkäriksi opiskellessaan hän teki opiskelutovereidensa parissa tutkimuksen vaivan yleisyydestä, ja tulokset julkaistiin hänen ensimmäisessä julkaisussaan 1942. Tärkein Kornbergiin kohdistetuista huomionosoituksista oli vuoden 1959 Nobel, mutta hän voitti lisäksi muun muassa National Medal of Sciencen 1979 ja oli Kansallisen tiedeakatemian jäsen vuodesta 1957. Hän teki aktiivisesti töitä Stanfordin yliopistolla vuosikymmenten ajan. Hän oli Royal Societyn ulkomaalaisjäsen. Kornberg oli vuosina 1943–1986 naimisissa Sylvy Ruth Levyn ja vuosina 1988–1995 Charlene Walsh Leveringin kanssa.

Schmitt received an A.B. in 1924 and a Ph.D. in 1927 from Washington University During a summer research program at the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole, Massachusetts in 1923, he worked with Haldan Keffer Hartline under the supervision Jacques Loeb and Thomas Hunt Morgan. Schmitt joined the faculty in 1929 and taught zoology until 1941. He collaborated extensively with Arthur H. Compton to develop x-ray diffraction techniques for biological macro-structures like muscles and nerves. In 1941, Schmitt was recruited by MIT's Karl Compton and Vannevar Bush to lead radically new Department of Biology there that would combine biology, physics, mathematics, and chemistry. Schmitt became an authority on electron microscopy and conducted innovative studies on kidney function, tissue metabolism, and the chemistry, physiology, biochemistry, and electrophysiology of the nerve. He became Institute Professor in 1955 and professor emeritus in 1973. In 1962, Schmitt helped to found the Neurosciences Research Program and served as its chairman from 1962 to 1974. Schmitt was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and a former president of the Electron Microscope Society of America. He was awarded the Albert Lasker Award in 1956, the Alsop Award in 1947, and the T. Duckett Jones Award in 1963."@en .

Hän oli preussilaisen ministeri, filosofi ja kielitieteilijä Wilhelm von Humboldtin nuorempi veli. Humboldtin teos kasvimaantieteestä oli eliömaantieteen perusteoksia. Humboldtin isä oli Alexander Georg von Humboldt, joka oli majuri Preussin armeijassa ja kuului huomattavaan pommerilaiseen sukuun. Alexander von Humboldt avioitui 1766 Maria Elizabeth von Colombin kanssa. Colomb oli paroni von Holweden leski. Perheeseen syntyi kaksi poikaa, joista toinen oli Alexander. Humboldt opiskeli Frankfurtin ja Göttingenin yliopistoissa sekä Freiburgin kaivosakatemiassa. Hänen ajatuksiinsa vaikutti suuresti geologi Abraham Gottlob Werner. Nuorena hän työskenteli Preussin kaivoshuollossa. 1790 hän vieraili Pariisissa Georg Forsterin kanssa. Vuodesta 1796 alkaen hän oli taloudellisesti riippumaton tutkija. Hän jatkoi opintojaan Jenassa ja tapasi muun muassa Goethen ja Schillerin. Humboldt matkusteli vuosina 1799–1804 Latinalaisessa Amerikassa yhdessä kasvitieteilijä Aimé Bonplandin kanssa ja tutki sekä kuvaili aluetta ensimmäisenä tieteellisestä näkökulmasta. Hän kirjoitti matkaa käsittelevät kuvauksensa valtavaksi kirjasarjaksi 21 vuoden aikana. Hän oli ensimmäisiä, joka ehdotti, että Atlanttia reunustavat maa-alueet ovat aikoinaan olleet yhdessä, etenkin Etelä-Amerikka ja Afrikka. Myöhemmin hän pyrki viisiosaisessa teoksessaan Kosmos yhdistämään eri tiedonaloja. Humboldt oli yhteistyössä muiden tieteilijöiden kanssa, kuten Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac, Justus von Liebig, Louis Agassiz ja Matthew Fontaine Maury. Humboldt nimesi useita lintulajeja, muun muassa kolumbiankaklattajan (Ortalis garrula) ja rasvakehrääjän (Steatornis caripensis). Hänen kunniakseen on nimetty ainakin perunpingviini (Spheniscus humboldti). Humboldt ei mennyt naimisiin, eikä hänellä tiettävästi ollut lapsia. Koska hän tuhosi kaiken kirjeenvaihtonsa, ei varmaa dokumentointia ole, mutta aikalaisten mukaan hän oli homoseksuaali. Hänellä tiedetään olleen vain kaksi rakkaussuhdetta naisen kanssa, ohjaajansa Marcus Herzin vaimoon ja Pauline Wieseliin vuonna 1808 Pariisissa."@fi , "Friedrich Wilhelm Heinrich Alexander von Humboldt o senzillament Alexander von Humboldt fou un explorador, naturalista i geògraf alemany, germà del lingüista i polític Wilhelm von Humboldt.

        ns4:abstract  "George Robert Carruthers (born October 1, 1939 in Cincinnati, Ohio) is an African American inventor, physicist, and space scientist. He has lived most of his life on the South Side of Chicago. George Robert Carruthers was born in Cincinnati, Ohio on October 1, 1939 and grew up in South Side, Chicago. His father was a civil engineer and his mother was a homemaker. The family lived in Milford, Ohio until Carruthers' father died suddenly and his mother moved the family back to her native Chicago. At an early age George developed an interest in physics, which his father encouraged. Also as a child, he enjoyed visiting Chicago museums, libraries and the planetarium that caused him to be an avid science-fiction reader and enjoyed constructing model rockets. Later he became a member of the Chicago Rocket Society and various science clubs. In 1957, he earned his high school diploma from Englewood High School. This was the same year that the Russians launched the first Sputnik. After high school he entered to the College of Engineering at the University of Illinois, getting his bachelor's of science degree in aeronautical engineering in the year of 1961. He also did his graduate work at the University of Illinois earning his masters degree in nuclear engineering in 1962 and his Ph.D. in aeronautical and astronomical engineering. While conducting his graduate studies, Carruthers worked as researcher and teaching assistant studying plasma and gases. By 1964, Carruthers began employment for the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C. where his work focused on far ultraviolet astronomy. 1969 was the year he received a patent for his invention, the \"Image Converter,\" which detected electromagnetic radiation in short wave lengths, and in 1970, he made the first examination of molecular hydrogen in space. Two years later, Carruthers invented the first moon-based observatory, the Far Ultraviolet Camera/ Spectrograph, which was used in the Apollo 16 mission. During the 1980s, Carruthers helped create a program called the Science &amp; Engineers Apprentice Program, which allows high school students to spend a summer working with scientists at the Naval Research Laboratory. Later on in 1986, one of Carruthers' inventions captured an ultraviolet image of Halley's Comet. In 1991, he invented a camera that was used in the Space Shuttle Mission. During the summers of 1996 and 1997 he taught a course in Earth and Space Science for D.C. Public Schools Science teachers. He also helped develop a series of videotapes on Earth and Space science for high school students. Since 1983 he has been Chairman of the Editing and Review Committee and Editor, Journal of the National Technical Association. Since 2002, Carruthers has been teaching a two-semester course in Earth and Space Science at Howard University sponsored by a NASA Aerospace Workforce Development Grant. On February 12, 2009, Dr. George Carruthers was honored as a Distinguished Lecturer at the Office of Naval Research for his achievements in the field of space science. He is a member of the American Astronomical Society, the American Geophysical Union, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science."@en .

He acquired his Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Cincinnati in 1959, after publishing the shell sort algorithm in the Communications of the ACM in July the same year. After acquiring the BS, he went into the Army Corps of Engineers, and from there to Philippines to help repair damages during World War II. When he returned after the war, he married Alice McCullough and returned to Michigan Technological University, where he taught mathematics. After, he moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, and worked for General Electric's engines division, where he developed a convergence algorithm and wrote a program to perform performance cycle calculations for aircraft jet engines. He also went to the University of Cincinnati, where in 1951 he acquired a M.S. in mathematics and, in 1959, acquired his Ph.D. in Mathematics. In July of that year he published the shell sort algorithm and \"The Share 709 System: A Cooperative Effort\". In 1958, he and A. Spitzbart had published \"A Chebycheff Fitting Criterion\". Although he is most widely known for his shell sort algorithm, his Ph.D. is also considered by some to be the first major investigation of the convergence of infinite exponentials, with some very deep results of the convergence into the complex plane. This area has grown considerably and research related to it is now investigated in what is more commonly called Tetration. After acquiring his Ph.D. , Shell moved to Schenectady, New York, to become Manager of Engineering for General Electric's new Information Services Department, the first commercial enterprise to link computers together using the client-server architecture. In October 1962 he wrote \"On the Convergence of Infinite Exponentials\" in the Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society. He worked with John George Kemeny and Thomas Eugene Kurtz to commercialize the Dartmouth Time-Sharing System in 1963. In 1971 Shell wrote \"Optimizing the Polyphase Sort\" in the Communications of the ACM, and in 1972 he joined with Mr. Ralph Mosher, a close friend and colleague, to start a business called Robotics Inc. where he was the General Manager and chief software engineer. Four years later, in 1976, they sold the company and Shell returned to General Electric Information Services Corporation. In 1984 he retired and moved to North Carolina where he lives today."@en .

        ns4:abstract  "Butler W. Lampson (born 1943) is a renowned computer scientist. After graduating from the Lawrenceville School (where in 2009 he was awarded the Aldo Leopold Award, also known as the Lawrenceville Medal, Lawrenceville's highest award to alumni), Lampson received his Bachelor's degree in Physics from Harvard University in 1964, and his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from the University of California, Berkeley in 1967. During the 1960s, Lampson and others were part of Project GENIE at UC Berkeley. In 1965, several Project GENIE members, specifically Lampson and Peter Deutsch, developed the Berkeley Timesharing System for Scientific Data Systems' SDS 940 computer. Lampson was one of the founding members of Xerox PARC in 1970, where he worked in the Computer Science Laboratory (CSL). His now-famous vision of a personal computer was captured in the 1972 memo entitled \"Why Alto?\". In 1973, the Xerox Alto, with its three-button mouse and full-page-sized monitor was born, and is now considered to be the first actual personal computer (at least in terms of what has become the 'canonical' GUI mode of operation). All the subsequent computers built at Xerox PARC followed a general blueprint called \"Wildflower\", written by Lampson, and this included the D-Series Machines, the \"Dolphin\" (used in the Xerox 1100 LISP machine), \"Dandelion\" (used in the Xerox 8010 model of the Xerox Star and Xerox 1108 LISP machine), \"Dandetiger\" (used in the Xerox 1109 LISP machine), \"Dorado\" (used in the Xerox 1132 LISP machine), \"Daybreak\" Xerox 6085, and \"Dragon\" (a 4-processor 6085 with one of the first snoopy caches, though never released to production). At PARC, Lampson helped work on many other revolutionary technologies, such as laser printer design; two-phase commit protocols; Bravo, the first WYSIWYG text formatting program; Ethernet, the first high-speed local area network (LAN); and designed several influential programming languages such as Euclid. By the early 1980s, Lampson left Xerox PARC for Digital Equipment Corporation; he now works for Microsoft Research. Lampson is also an adjunct professor at MIT. In 1992, he won the distinguished ACM Turing Award for his contributions to personal computing and computer science and in 1994 he was inducted as a Fellow of the ACM. In 2004, he won the Charles Stark Draper Prize along with Alan C. Kay, Robert W. Taylor, and Charles P. Thacker for their work on Alto Lampson is often quoted as saying \"Any problem in computer science can be solved with another level of indirection\", but in his Turing Award Lecture in 1993, Lampson himself attributes this saying to David Wheeler."@en .

Cocke spent his entire career as an industrial researcher for IBM, from 1956 to 1992. Perhaps the project where his innovations were most noted was in the IBM 801 minicomputer, where his realization that matching the design of the architecture's instruction set to the relatively simple instructions actually emitted by compilers could allow high performance at a low cost. He is one of the inventors of CYK algorithm (C for Cocke). Cocke won the Eckert-Mauchly Award in 1985, ACM Turing Award in 1987, the National Medal of Technology in 1991 and the National Medal of Science in 1994, and the Seymour Cray Computer Science and Engineering Award in 1999.

Dr. Garnett's principal laboratory discoveries reveal the presence of corollary dynamics of the genetic code by which specific DNA coded segments and cell membranes exchange ultra-low frequency sinusoidal electrical currents. According to his theory, these pulsed currents are the basis of all physiological pulses and determine the polarization, charge and folding of enzymes, nucleic acids and membrane phospholipids. The restoration of these charge transfer pathways form the basis of several new methods of medicinal management. Garnett refers to this area of research as Electrogenetics: Electrogenetics is the basis for designing medicines that can short circuit the electrical charges in cancer cells and produce their selective electrocution.

At the University of Chicago, he received a Bachelor's degree in liberal arts in 1953 (when still only 17) and a second Bachelor's degree in physics in 1958. Becoming a computer operator in the early 1960s, he began publishing many noteworthy papers and was appointed an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon University by the time he was 27 and became a full professor at Stanford University six years later. He obtained this position without a Ph.D. His contributions include the design of Floyd's algorithm, which efficiently finds all shortest paths in a graph, and work on parsing. In one isolated paper he introduced the important concept of error diffusion for rendering images, also called Floyd–Steinberg dithering (though he distinguished dithering from diffusion). A significant achievement was pioneering the field of program verification using logical assertions with the 1967 paper Assigning Meanings to Programs. This was an important contribution to what later became Hoare logic. Floyd worked closely with Donald Knuth, in particular as the major reviewer for Knuth's seminal book The Art of Computer Programming, and is the person most cited in that work. He was the co-author, with Richard Beigel, of the textbook The Language of Machines: an Introduction to Computability and Formal Languages (1994, W.H. Freeman and Company, ISBN 978-0716782667). He received the Turing Award in 1978 \"for having a clear influence on methodologies for the creation of efficient and reliable software, and for helping to found the following important subfields of computer science: the theory of parsing, the semantics of programming languages, automatic program verification, automatic program synthesis, and analysis of algorithms\". Floyd married and divorced twice, and had four children. His hobbies included backgammon and hiking."@en .

The game was somewhat of a success and is still recognized today as one of the landmark games for early home computers. After finishing version 2.0 of SunDog, Webster quit FTL due to burn-out. His disenchantment with programming was so severe that he did not take another programming job for four years. Instead Webster went on to write for BYTE and Macworld and taught computer science at his alma mater of Brigham Young University.

        ns4:abstract  "Barbara McClintock (June 16, 1902 – September 2, 1992), the 1983 Nobel Laureate in Physiology or Medicine, was an American scientist and one of the world's most distinguished cytogeneticists. McClintock received her PhD in botany from Cornell University in 1927, where she was a leader in the development of maize cytogenetics. The field remained the focus of her research for the rest of her career. From the late 1920s, McClintock studied chromosomes and how they change during reproduction in maize. Her work was groundbreaking: she developed the technique for visualizing maize chromosomes and used microscopic analysis to demonstrate many fundamental genetic ideas, including genetic recombination by crossing-over during meiosis—a mechanism by which chromosomes exchange information. She produced the first genetic map for maize, linking regions of the chromosome with physical traits, and demonstrated the role of the telomere and centromere, regions of the chromosome that are important in the conservation of genetic information. She was recognized amongst the best in the field, awarded prestigious fellowships, and elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1944. During the 1940s and 1950s, McClintock discovered transposition and used it to show how genes are responsible for turning physical characteristics on or off. She developed theories to explain the repression or expression of genetic information from one generation of maize plants to the next. Encountering skepticism of her research and its implications, she stopped publishing her data in 1953. Later, she made an extensive study of the cytogenetics and ethnobotany of maize races from South America. McClintock's research became well understood in the 1960s and 1970s, as researchers demonstrated the mechanisms of genetic change and genetic regulation that she had demonstrated in her maize research in the 1940s and 1950s. Awards and recognition for her contributions to the field followed, including the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine, awarded to her in 1983 for the discovery of genetic transposition; she is the only woman to receive an unshared Nobel Prize in that category."@en .

He helped pioneer the development of VLSI theory, including the retiming method of digital optimization with James B. Saxe and systolic arrays with H. T. Kung. He conceived of the notion of cache-oblivious algorithms, which are algorithms that have no tuning parameters for cache size or cache-line length, but nevertheless use cache near-optimally. He developed the Cilk language for multithreaded programming, which uses a provably good work-stealing algorithm for scheduling. Leiserson received a B.S. degree in computer science and mathematics from Yale University in 1975, and a Ph.D. degree in computer science from Carnegie Mellon University in 1981, where his advisors were Jon Bentley and H.

A meteorite was named in his honor by the International Astronomical Union, IAU in 2000: 4597 Consolmagno, also known as \"Little Guy\". He believes in the need for science and religion to work alongside one another rather than as competing ideologies. In 2006, he said, \"Religion needs science to keep it away from superstition and keep it close to reality, to protect it from creationism, which at the end of the day is a kind of paganism - it's turning God into a nature god.\".

Em 1961, esta situação levou-lhe (e a Kazuhiko Nishijima) a introduzir uma classificação de partículas elementares chamada hadrons. Este esquema é agora explicado pelo modelo quark. O nome dado pelo próprio Gell-Mann para o sistema de classificação foi o caminho dos oito preceitos, devido aos octetos de partículas na classificação. O termo é uma referência ao Nobre Caminho Óctuplo do budismo - uma escolha que é reflexo dos seus eclético interesses. Gell-Mann e, de forma independente, George Zweig, prosseguiu, em 1964, para postular a existência de quarks, as partículas a partir da qual os hadrons, até então tidos como indivisíveis, são compostos. O nome foi cunhado por Gell-Mann e é uma referência ao romance Finnegans Wake, de James Joyce (\"Três quarks para Muster Mark!\" - Livro 2, episódio 4).

In 1998 Luby left ICSI to found the Digital Fountain company, and shortly thereafter in 1998 he invented the LT codes, the first practical fountain codes. Subsequently, Amin Shokrollahi (Digital Fountain's Chief Scientist) invented the Raptor codes, which are an extension of LT codes, and which are the first fountain codes with linear time encoding and decoding. Current Digital Fountain products are based on advanced versions of Raptor codes, and these codes have been adopted into a number of International Standards for mobile broadcast and IPTV applications, including 3GPP MBMS, DVB-H, and DVB-IPI.

        ns4:abstract  "Edward Fredkin (born 1934) is an early pioneer of digital physics. In recent work, he uses the term digital philosophy (DP). His primary contributions include his work on reversible computing and cellular automata. While Konrad Zuse's book, Calculating Space (1969), mentioned the importance of reversible computation, the Fredkin gate represented the essential breakthrough. Edward Fredkin dropped out of Caltech after one year and, at age 19, joined the USAF where he became a jet fighter pilot. Fredkin’s computer career started in 1956 when the Air Force assigned him to work at MIT Lincoln Laboratory. He worked at BBN in the early 1960s where he wrote the first PDP-1 assembler. In 1968, Fredkin returned to academia, starting at MIT as a full professor. From 1971 to 1974 he was the Director of Project MAC. He spent a year at Caltech as a Fairchild Distinguished Scholar, working with Richard Feynman, and was a Professor of Physics at Boston University for 6 years. More recently, he has been a Distinguished Career Professor at Carnegie Mellon University and a Visiting Professor at MIT. Fredkin founded Information International Inc. and has served as the CEO of a diverse set of companies, including Information International, Three Rivers Computer Corporation, and New England Television Corporation (owner of Boston's then CBS affiliate, WNEV, channel 7). Fredkin has been broadly interested in computation: hardware and software. He is the inventor of the trie data structure, the Fredkin gate and the Billiard-Ball Computer Model for reversible computing. He has also been involved in computer vision, chess, and other areas of Artificial Intelligence research. Fredkin also works at the intersection of theoretical issues in the physics of computation and computational models of physics. He recently developed Salt, a model of computation based on fundamental conservation laws from physics. A profile of Edward Fredkin along with a readable explanation of some of his theories can be found in the first part of Three Scientists and Their Gods by Robert Wright (1988). The section of the book covering Fredkin was excerpted in The Atlantic Monthly in April 1988."@en .

He was involved in early work on time-sharing through the PDP-1 which his group owned at MIT; that machine is famous in computer science as the machine on which hacker culture started. He shepherded the MIT Model Railroad Club. Later, he was one of the founding members of the Multics project, to which he contributed one of its most important concepts, the single-level memory. Multics, though not particularly commercially successful in itself, was an inspiration for Ken Thompson to develop Unix. The latter part of his career was devoted to non-von Neumann models of computation, architecture, and languages. He wanted to free programs from the concept of a program counter. So adopting the concept of \"single-assignment,\" he along with his students and others developed data flow concepts which executed instructions as soon as data became available (this specific model came to be called \"static\" in contrast to Arvind's later \"dynamic\"). He retired from MIT in 1987 to do independent projects and consulting. He developed the VAL static data-flow language which in turn inspired the compiler for the SISAL programming language and was a visiting scientist at NASA's Research Institute for Advanced Computer Science (RIACS). In 1994 he was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery. He was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2009. He has a fondness for tea, instead of coffee."@en .

In March, 2005, he held an event to announce \"the fundamental mechanism of cognition\", which he believes is a process of confabulation (neural networks). He posits that all actions and thoughts begin as the \"winners\" of competitions, where confabulations are tested for cogency based on antecedent support. He presented some mathematical models of the proposed mechanism, and some experimental results where software using this system was able to add several words to a stub of a sentence, keeping that stub coherent and, optionally, maintaining some connection to a full input sentence supplied as context. For example, given \"But the other ... \" the program returns \"But the other semifinal match between fourth-seeded ...\". Given \"Japan manufactures many consumer products. \" for context, and the same three-word stub, it returns \"But the other executives included well-known companies ...\". Five pages of such examples were given. He made red, green, and blue-striped medallions to commemorate the event, and had them distributed to the audience along with pamphlets explaining their significance: \"This new era, which as yet has no name, will be characterized by the eternal universal freedom from want provided by intelligent machines.\""@en .

He was an expert in many aspects of human neurophysiology and perception, and a central theme of his research was to design artificial intelligence systems based on his understanding of how the human brain works. He was one of the early proponents of incorporation into artificial intelligence algorithms, methods for dealing with uncertainty. Uhr published seven books (as author and/or editor) and nearly 150 journal and conference papers. His seminal work was an article written in 1963 with Charles Vossler, \"A Pattern Recognition Program That Generates, Evaluates, and Adjusts Its Own Operators,\" reprinted in Computers and Thought — edited by Edward Feigenbaum and J. Feldman — which showcases the work of the scientists who defined the field of artificial intelligence. He served as Ph.D. major professor for 20 students, many of whom have gone on to become in their own right important contributors to artificial intelligence. Leonard Uhr graduated from Princeton University in 1949, with a B.A. in Psychology. He received masters degrees in Philosophy from the University of Brussels and Johns Hopkins University in 1951 before obtaining his Ph.D. in Psychology in 1957 from the University of Michigan.

Es un doctor holandés de edad avanzada y de variados intereses y logros, en parte confirmado por la serie de títulos que posee: doctor en medicina, doctor en filosofía, doctor en letras, etc. , luego de conocer a Lucy (gracias a un amigo en común el Dr Seward)empieza a desarrollar una aptitud para cazar vampiros. En la novela, van Helsing es llamado por su antiguo estudiante Dr Seward, a ayudar con la misteriosa enfermedad de Lucy Westenra. Es van Helsing el que se da cuenta de que Lucy es víctima de un vampiro y guía al Dr. Seward y sus amigos en sus esfuerzos para salvar a Lucy. Algunas adaptaciones a la novela han tendido a sobresaltar el rol de van Helsing como un experto en vampiros, algunas veces hasta el grado que esto representa la mayor ocupación del personaje. En la novela, sin embargo, el Dr. Seward no sospecha de esta característica de su viejo amigo (y además, no tiene sospechas de que los vampiros realmente existen, no mencionando que hay uno involucrado en el caso) y le pide su ayuda simplemente porque la aflicción de Lucy lo había desconcertado y van Helsing sabía de \"males extraños\" como nadie más en el mundo. Actores reconocidos han interpretado a van Helsing en varias versiones de pantalla, incluyendo a Edward van Sloan en la película de Universal Studios Drácula de 1931, Peter Cushing en Drácula del año 1958 de Hammer Films', Laurence Olivier la de 1979, Anthony Hopkins en Drácula de Bram Stoker (1992) y Mel Brooks en la parodia hecha en 1995. En la película Van Helsing (2004) de Stephen Sommers, el personaje no corresponde con ninguna de las características del original y hacen la alusión de que Van Helsing es el arcángel Gabriel, interpretado por Hugh Jackman. El Van Helsing interpretado por Peter Cushing, podemos considerarlo una variante propia que encajaba en el Universo de la Hammer, una productora especializada en el terror. Este Van Helsing era considerablemente más joven, aunque se movía en el mismo lapso cronológico del Van Helsing original. Doctor en Metafisica, Medicina, Teologia... por la universidad de Heidelberg, no tiene una nacionalidad definida a pesar de su apellido Holandés. Además, hubo numerosos trabajos hechos con los descendientes de van Helsing, que también debían pelear contra vampiros. Los ejemplos incluyen la historieta La tumba de Drácula, protagonizada por Rachel van Helsing como miembro fundamental entre los cazadores. También existe un manga llamado Hellsing, en el cual Integra Hellsing lidera un grupo especial del gobierno británico (incluyendo un vampiro llamado Alucard, quien se cree que es el mismísimo Drácula, aunque no está confirmado) que luchan contra amenazas sobrenaturales; además, como mención curiosa, un personaje de la serie llamado Paladín Alexander Anderson, un sacerdote Católico cazavampiros que trabaja para la Sección XIII (una organización con fines similares a Hellsing) y que luchó contra Alucard, está basado físicamente en el van Helsing interpretado por el actor Edward van Sloan. La película Drácula 2000 en la que el conde renace en pleno siglo XX y su principal rival es la joven Mary Heller (Mary van Helsing), a la cual Drácula intenta convertir en vampiresa y ponerla de su lado.

A graduate of the Bronx High School of Science, he received a B.S. in mathematics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1960, and M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in mathematics from Brandeis University, respectively in 1963 and 1972. His dissertation was about singularities in analytic partial differential equations. Lamport is best known for his seminal work in distributed systems and as the initial developer of the document preparation system LaTeX. Professionally, Lamport worked as a computer scientist at Massachusetts Computer Associates, SRI International, Digital Equipment Corporation, and Compaq. In 2001 he joined Microsoft Research at Mountain View, California. Lamport’s research contributions have laid the foundations of the theory of distributed systems. Among his most notable papers are “Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System”, which received the PODC Influential Paper Award in 2000, “How to Make a Multiprocessor Computer That Correctly Executes Multiprocess Programs”, which defined the notion of Sequential consistency, “The Byzantine Generals Problem”, “Distributed Snapshots: Determining Global States of a Distributed System” and “The Part-Time Parliament”. These papers relate to such concepts as logical clocks (and the happened-before relationship) and Byzantine failures. They are among the most cited papers in the field of computer science and describe algorithms to solve many fundamental problems in distributed systems, including: the Paxos algorithm for consensus, the bakery algorithm for mutual exclusion of multiple threads in a computer system that require the same resources at the same time and the snapshot algorithm for the determination of consistent global states. Lamport is also known for his work on temporal logic, where he introduced the temporal logic of actions (TLA). Among his more recent contributions is TLA, a logic for specifying and reasoning about concurrent and reactive systems, that he describes in the book “Specifying Systems: The TLA Language and Tools for Hardware and Software Engineers” and defines as a “quixotic attempt to overcome engineers' antipathy towards mathematics”. Lamport received four honorary doctorates from European universities: University of Rennes and Christian Albrechts University of Kiel in 2003, EPFL in 2004 and University of Lugano in 2006. In 2004, he received the IEEE Piore Award. In 2005, the paper “Reaching Agreement in the Presence of Faults” received the Dijkstra Prize. In honor of Lamport's sixtieth birthday, a lecture series was organised at the 20th Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing (PODC 2001). Lamport is the author of the aphorism:"@en .

Kompfner was born in Vienna to Jewish parents. He was originally trained as an architect and after receiving his university degree in 1933 he moved to England (due to the rise of anti-Semitism) where he worked as an architect until 1941. However, he had a strong interest in physics and electronics, and after being briefly detained by the British as an enemy alien at the start of World War II he was recruited to work in a secret microwave vacuum tube research program at the University of Birmingham. While there, Kompfner invented the TWT in 1943. After the war he became a British citizen, continued working for the Admiralty as a scientist, and also studied physics at the University of Oxford, receiving his PhD in 1951. Late that year Dr. Kompfner was recruited to Bell Labs in the United States by John R. Pierce, where they together developed the TWT into an important element of the communications age.

        ns4:abstract  "Joseph Priestley (13 March 1733 – 6 February 1804) was an 18th-century English theologian, Dissenting clergyman, natural philosopher, educator, and political theorist who published over 150 works. He is usually credited with the discovery of oxygen, having isolated it in its gaseous state, although Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Antoine Lavoisier also have a claim to the discovery. During his lifetime, Priestley's considerable scientific reputation rested on his invention of soda water, his writings on electricity, and his discovery of several \"airs\" (gases), the most famous being what Priestley dubbed \"dephlogisticated air\" (oxygen). However, Priestley's determination to defend phlogiston theory and to reject what would become the Chemical Revolution eventually left him isolated within the scientific community. Priestley's science was integral to his theology, and he consistently tried to fuse Enlightenment rationalism with Christian theism. In his metaphysical texts, Priestley attempted to combine theism, materialism, and determinism, a project that has been called \"audacious and original\". He believed that a proper understanding of the natural world would promote human progress and eventually bring about the Christian Millennium. Priestley, who strongly believed in the free and open exchange of ideas, advocated toleration and equal rights for religious Dissenters, which also led him to help found Unitarianism in England. The controversial nature of Priestley's publications combined with his outspoken support of the French Revolution aroused public and governmental suspicion; he was eventually forced to flee, in 1791, first to London, and then to the United States, after a mob burned down his home and church. He spent the last ten years of his life living in Northumberland County, Pennsylvania. A scholar and teacher throughout his life, Priestley also made significant contributions to pedagogy, including the publication of a seminal work on English grammar and the invention of modern historiography. These educational writings were some of Priestley's most popular works. It was his metaphysical works, however, that had the most lasting influence: leading philosophers including Jeremy Bentham, John Stuart Mill, and Herbert Spencer credit them among the primary sources for utilitarianism."@en , "Joseph Priestley was an English chemist, philosopher, clergyman, and teacher.

Levin's journal article on this theorem was published in 1973; he had lectured on the ideas in it for some years before that time, though complete formal writing of the results took place after Cook's publication.

É um dos fundadores e professor do Media Lab, o laboratório de multimídia do Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), onde é financiado por mais de 105 empresas, incluindo as maiores corporações dos Estados Unidos da América e as grandes empresas da indústria do entretenimento. Ele também assina a coluna da revista Wired e é muito reconhecido no universo da informática. É considerado brilhante e caracteriza seus conceitos no seu famoso livro “A vida digital”, conceitos muito discutidos, pois são irreverentes e otimistas. Negroponte estudou no MIT, onde se especializou no então novo campo de computer aided design (CAD), ou Projeto assistido por computador. Entre suas explicações ele começa determinando a diferença entre bits e átomos. Para Negroponte a natureza física, constituída de átomos, passa a ser transmitida e “transformada” em outra natureza, a natureza digital (bits) “É o menor elemento atômico no DNA da informação” . Como não é baseada em matéria física, a informação em bits pode ser transmitida cada vez mais em um tempo e espaço menor, ultrapassando os limites da informática e estando cada vez mais presentes na vida dos seres humanos. Haverá uma interação maior entre os humanos de todos os lados do mundo, compartilhamento idéias e isso de uma forma cada vez mais dinâmica. Assim como grandes computadores transformaram-se hoje em laptops e palmtops que podem ser carregados até em bolsos. Além disso, será cada vez maior a interatividade e o mundo digital irá se adaptar há quem o serve, sendo cada vez mais personalizado. O conceito de multimédia também foi descrito por Negroponte. Ele defende a interação entre bits, a mistura entre bits de vídeo e bits de áudio. Entre esses e outros, mostra a importância dos computadores e meios digitais serem mais “inteligentes”, para ele não somos nós que temos que nos adaptar e sim os meios a nós, a interface deverá ser “moldada” para cada usuário, facilitando sua manipulação. Enfim, em suas teorias, mostra como os meios digitais facilitam e vão dominar nossa próxima era, como o e-mail, que é muito mais barato e tem inúmeras vantagens em relação a um fax, a globalização fará com que não haja barreira aos bits, e a partir daí todo o estilo de vida humano passará por um processo enorme de transformação. Segundo Negroponte, toda indústria que possui uma posição dominante deve buscar formas de se diversificar, a tecnologia pode ser a resposta. Um exemplo são fabricantes de postes de luz e bueiros, talvez. Postes de iluminação pública são ideais para a instalação de estações-base para acesso Wi-Fi: \"Cada poste poderia ser uma estação de conexão peer-to-peer\", afirma. \"Os bueiros são instalados em espaços regulares nas ruas das cidades, e poderiam ser usados para alguma coisa. Quem sabe? Esta é uma boa hora para essas empresas começarem a pensar em possibilidades inesperadas\".

        ns4:abstract  "Jonathan Pool, born 1942 in Chicago, is a political scientist from the United States. He works on the political and economic consequences of linguistic circumstances and language policy. Pool studied political science in Harvard between 1960 and 1964. He then joined the Peace Corps and went to Turkey, where he taught English. After his return he studied in Chicago, where he graduated in 1968 and earned his PhD in 1971. Pool worked at the universities of Chicago, New York (Stony Brook), Washington (Seattle), Stanford as well as in Mannheim, Paderborn, and Bielefeld in Germany. After 1996 he worked as a chief strategist for Centerplex, an enterprise in Tukwila, Washington, near Seattle. He now is president of Utilika Foundation. Pool has always been impressed by the degree to which peoples' first language and lingustic knowledge influence their lives. When, as a nine-year-old, he had a friend whose parents had immigrated from Brazil, he decided to learn Portuguese while his friend learned English, for reasons of fairness. While teaching English in Turkey he was surprised to find how many people got their jobs on the basis of their knowledge of languages rather than of their professional skills. This influenced the choice of his research field; in 1981 he published a paper on the measurement of the consequences of linguistic discrimination. At that time he met Reinhard Selten, with whom he worked on the application of game theory on problems of lingustic diversity. In 1991 he published a research paper proposing an economic compensation for the need to learn languages. This was an early form of the concept of a language tax."@en .

        ns4:abstract  "Daniel Kirkwood (September 27, 1814 - June 11, 1895) was an American astronomer. Born in Harford County, Maryland, he was graduated in mathematics from the York County Academy in York, Pennsylvania in 1838. After teaching there for five years, he became Principal of the Lancaster High School in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and after another five years he moved on to become Principal of the Pottsville Academy in Pottsville, Pennsylvania. In 1851 he became Professor of Mathematics at Delaware College and in 1856 Professor of Mathematics at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana, where he stayed until his retirement in 1886, with the exception of two years, 1865-1867, at Jefferson College in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. Kirkwood's most significant contribution came from his study of asteroid orbits. When arranging the then-growing number of discovered asteroids by their distance from the Sun, he noted several gaps, now named Kirkwood gaps in his honor, and associated these gaps with orbital resonances with the orbit of Jupiter. Further, Kirkwood also suggested a similar dynamic was responsible for Cassini Division in Saturn's rings, as the result of a resonance with one of Saturn's moons. In the same paper, he was the first to correctly posit that the material in meteor showers is cometary debris. Kirkwood also identified a pattern relating the distances of the planets to their rotation periods, which was called Kirkwood's Law. This discovery earned Kirkwood an international reputation among astronomers; he was dubbed \"the American Kepler\" by Sears Cook Walker, who claimed that Kirkwood's Law proved the widely held Solar Nebula Theory. The \"Law\" has since become discredited as new measurements of planetary rotation periods have shown that the pattern doesn't hold. In 1891, at age 77, he became a lecturer in astronomy at Stanford University. He died in Riverside, California in 1895. Altogether he wrote 129 publications, including three books. The asteroid 1951 AT was named 1578 Kirkwood in his honor and so was the lunar impact crater Kirkwood, as well as Indiana University's Kirkwood Observatory. He is buried in the Rose Hill Cemetery in Bloomington, Indiana, where Kirkwood Avenue is named for him. Kirkwood was a cousin of Iowa governor Samuel Jordan Kirkwood who became United States Secretary of the Interior under President James A. Garfield and President Chester A. Arthur."@en .

Evans attended the University of Utah and studied electrical engineering; he earned his doctorate degree in physics. Evans first worked at the Bendix aviation electronics company, where he acted as project manager in 1955 to develop what some describe as an early personal computer that ran on an interpretive operating system. The Bendix G-15 was a bulky unit about the size of a two door refrigerator. He stayed with the company just long enough to manage the G-16 project. Evans subsequently worked on the GENIE multi-user timesharing system while at the University of California, Berkeley. Evans was appointed a member of UC Berkeley's faculty. In addition, through his work at the Pentagon's Advanced Research Project Agency, he made key developments in the field of virtual memory. His first important works with graphics also dates from that period, when he did several experiments on an IDIOM display hooked up to a DEC PDP-5. When he was building up the University of Utah department in 1968 he managed to convince Ivan Sutherland to come to Utah, accepting the condition that they start a computer graphics company together. Evans retired from the company in 1994. Evans was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). He served as a branch president, a counselor in bishoprics and stake presidencies, and as a scout master for a total of 27 years. Evans was award the Silver Beaver for his role in scouting. Evans married Joy Frewin. They had ten children, only seven of which lived to adulthood. One of these is David F. Evans, who became a general authority in the LDS Church. From 1984 to 1990, Joy Evans was a counselor in the general presidency of the Relief Society to Barbara W. Winder. At the time of his death in 1998 Evans had 39 living grandchildren and great grandchildren. In 1996, Brigham Young University established the David C.

        ns4:abstract  "Claude Elwood Shannon - amerykański matematyk i inżynier, profesor MIT. Jeden z twórców teorii informacji. Jako jeden z pierwszych pojął doniosłość kodu binarnego i już jako młody człowiek proroczo twierdził, że ciągami zer i jedynek da się opisać tekst, obraz i dźwięk. Stworzył modele procesu komunikacyjnego wykorzystywane później przez psychologów. Jego najsłynniejsze dzieło to \"Matematyczna teoria komunikacji\" (PDF ok. 360 kB) opublikowana w 1948 roku, która położyła podwaliny pod teorię informacji i kodowania. Braki wspomnianej teorii, czyli niemożliwość wytłumaczenia wartości (cenności) informacji próbowali później uzupełnić inni autorzy. Shannon zafascynowany był maszynami liczącymi i urządzeniami, które dziś określilibyśmy mianem gadżetów - zaprojektował np. pianino odtwarzające w kolejności losowej zaprogramowane uprzednio utwory muzyczne, czy samouczącą się mysz (znajdowała drogę przez labirynt, na którego końcu Shannon kładł kawałek sera). Pracował także nad sztuczną inteligencją, rozwijając koncepcje maszyn Turinga, czego efektem było m. in. stworzenie w 1956 r. komputera szachowego MANIAC 1. Zafascynowany algebrą Boole'a starał się znaleźć jej zastosowanie w programowaniu przełączników obwodów elektrycznych. W wyniku tego zafascynowania w 1938 roku opracował metodę szybkiego przetwarzania danych które zostało wykorzystane do sterowania elektronicznymi przekaźnikami. W roku 1948, zajmując się zagadnieniem przepustowości linii telefonicznych, Shannon opracował wiele ważnych do dziś formuł matematycznych, które stanowią podstawę nowoczesnej teorii informacji. Jego twierdzenia nabrały szczególnego znaczenia praktycznego po wynalezieniu układów scalonych. Bez przesady można powiedzieć, że teorie tego wielkiego naukowca leżą u podstaw współczesnej ekspansji komputerów i Internetu. \"Rewolucja cyfrowa zaczęła się od niego\" powiedział na wieść o śmierci wielkiego uczonego słynny amerykański informatyk Neil Sloane, wydawca i redaktor dzieł zebranych Shannona. \"Był to jeden z największych umysłów minionego stulecia - dodał - bez niego nie istniałyby dziś najważniejsze zdobycze naszej cywilizacji\". Shannon urodził się w Michigan i w University of Michigan uzyskał dyplomy w dziedzinie matematyki i inżynierii elektrycznej. Doktorat obronił w Massachusetts Institute of Technology w roku 1940; od roku 1958 był tam profesorem. W latach 1936-40 pracował w MIT, gdzie współpracował przy budowie mechanicznego analizatora dyferencjałów opracowanego przez Vannevera Busha. W latach 1941-1972 pracował również w słynnych Laboratoriach Bella. Na emeryturę przeszedł w roku 1978. Claude Shannon znany był z tego, że uprawianie nauki było dla niego nie tylko poważnym zajęciem, ale również radością i zabawą. Dla czystej zabawy na przykład skonstruował dziwaczną maszynę o nazwie THROBAC-I, która liczyła, wykorzystując... rzymski zapis liczb.

Shannonin työ loi pohjan muun muassa tietoliikenteen koodaukseen ja tiedon salaukseen. Shannon toimi MIT-yliopistossa ja Bell Labsilla. Shannon julkaisi vuonna 1948 artikkelin A Mathematical Theory of Communication, jossa tutkitaan tiedon siirtämisen ongelmia. Seuraavana vuonna hän julkaisi artikkelin Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems, jossa hän sovelsi teoriaansa salaukseen. Shannonin teorian perustana on informaation määritteleminen bittinä eli yhtenä kyllä/ei-päätöksenä. Tämän perusteella Shannon kehitti matematiikan haaran, jonka avulla informaation määrää voidaan käsitellä tarkasti. Shannon määritteli muun muassa termit informaation entropia ja redundanssi. Shannon myös kehitti Nyquistin teoreemaa, jonka mukaan analogisen signaalin siirtämiseen digitaalisen tiedonsiirtokanavan kautta tarvitaan suurimpaan signaalitaajuuteen verrattuna vähintään kaksinkertainen näytteenottotaajuus. Tätä pienemmillä näytteenottotaajuuksilla signaaliin aiheutuu ns. laskostumisvirheitä. Nyqvistin näytteenottoteoriaa hyödynnetään esimerkiksi digitaalisessa puhelintekniikassa. Koska hyvänlaatuisen puhesignaalin siirtämiseksi tarvittava suurin taajuus on noin 4000 Hz, digitaalinen keskus lähettää toiseen päähän 8000 näytettä puheesta sekunnissa. Fourier-muunnosten avulla Shannon todisti, että alkuperäinen analoginen signaali saadaan palautettua teoriassa täydellisesti näistä 8000 näytteestä. Teoria tunnetaankin nykyisin Nyquistin-Shannonin näytteenottoteoreemana.

Er gilt als Begründer der Informationstheorie."@de , "Claude Elwood Shannon was een Amerikaans wiskundige en elektrotechnicus en wordt wel de \"de vader van de informatietheorie\" genoemd. Claude E. Shannon was een ver familielid van Thomas Edison. In zijn jeugd werkte hij als boodschapper voor Western Union. Hij begon aan de studies elektronica en wiskunde aan de universiteit van Michigan in 1932, en behaalde zijn bachelorsgraad in 1936. Hij studeerde daarna aan het MIT, waar hij werkte aan de 'differential analyser' van Vannevar Bush, een analoge computer. Door dit werk zag hij in dat de Booleaanse algebra heel goed kon worden toegepast op de schakelingen die hiervoor nodig waren en zijn doctoraalscriptie uit 1937 aan het MIT A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits, legde de basis voor de wetenschap van het ontwerpen van digitale schakelingen. Hij toonde aan dat binair rekenen en booleaanse algebra konden worden gebruikt om de onderlinge verbindingen van schakelaars voor het tot stand brengen van telefoonverbindingen te vereenvoudigen, en draaide daarna de zaak om en toonde aan dat het mogelijk was om met combinaties van schakelaars problemen in de booleaanse algebra op te lossen. Het gebruik van de eigenschappen van dergelijke schakelingen op deze manier is de basis van alle digitale computers. Shannons theoretisch formalisme kwam in de plaats van de empirische technieken die tot dan toe werden gebruikt. Professor Howard Gardner, van de Harvard Universiteit, noemde deze scriptie \"possibly the most important, and also the most famous, master's thesis of the century\", (mogelijk de belangrijkste, en de bekendste, afstudeerscriptie van de eeuw). Een uittreksel ervan werd in 1938 gepubliceerd in de Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, en in 1940 ontving hij voor deze scriptie de 'Alfred Nobel Award' van het 'American Institute of American Engineers'. Shannon verwierf de doctorstitel (Ph.D. ) in 1940 aan het MIT met een proefschrift over wiskundige aspecten van de genetica An Algebra for Theoretical Genetics, en werkte daarna aan de Bell Labs totdat hij in de vijftiger jaren terugkeerde naar het MIT. In 1948 publiceerde hij A Mathematical Theory of Communication (Univ of Illinois Press). Deze publicatie behandelt het vraagstuk van het reconstrueren van de door een zender verstuurde informatie. Shannon ontwikkelde de entropie als een maat voor redundantie. Het boek, samen met Warren Weaver geschreven, is beknopt en verrassend toegankelijk voor de niet-specialist. Een andere belangwekkende publicatie, uit 1949, is Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems, waarin feitelijk de basis werd gelegd voor de wiskundige theorie van de cryptografie. Van 1958 tot 1978 was Claude Shannon professor aan het MIT. Daarnaast was hij privé een succesvol investeerder, mede door toepassing van mathematische technieken, en had hij belangstelling voor de speltheorie. Hij publiceerde een van de eerste programma's voor computerschaak, het maakte gebruik van een minimax-algoritme. Op latere leeftijd leed hij aan de ziekte van Alzheimer zodat hij de bloei van de computer-era, die hij zelf had helpen ontketenen, niet meer bewust heeft meegemaakt."@nl , "Claude Elwood Shannon &amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Petoskey (Michigan)) (pagina inesistente)\">Petoskey, 30 aprile 1916 – Medford, 24 febbraio 2001) è stato un ingegnere e matematico statunitense, spesso definito \"il padre della teoria dell'informazione\"."@it , "Claude Elwood Shannon var en amerikansk matematiker.

En sia magistra tezo, Simbola Analizo de Relajsaj kaj Ŝaltaj Cirkvitoj, li uzis bulean algebron por analizi kaj optimumigi relajsajn ŝalt-cirkvitojn. Lia doktora tezo temis pri teoria genetiko. Ĉe MIT, Shannon laboris pri la diferenciala analizilo, frua speco de meĥanika komputilo kreita de Vannevar BUSH por akiri nombrajn solvojn al ordinaraj diferencialaj ekvacioj. Shannon eklaboris ĉe AT&amp;T Bell Telephones en Nov-Ĵerzejo en 1941 kiel esplora matematikisto kaj restis ĉe la Laboratorio Bell ĝis 1972. Shannon aperigis Matematika Teorio de Komunikado en 1948. Tiu referaĵo fondis la fakon de informteorio. En ĝi li proponis sendi ne elektromagnetan ondojn tra drato, sed fluon de 1-oj kaj 0-oj, kiu ŝajnas memkomprenebla al ni nun, sed estis fundamente nova ideo tiutempe. En la referaĵo, kiu enkondukis la anglan vorton bit por la unua fojo, Shannon montris, ke per aldoni pliajn bitojn al signalo eblas rimarki aŭ eĉ korekti erarojn de sendado. Alia rimarkinda referaĵo de Shannon estas Komunikada Teorio de Sekretaj Sistemoj. Shannon estis vizitanta profesoro de komunikada scienco kaj matematiko ĉe MIT en 1956. En 1957 li ricevis postenon en la fakultato tie. Lia posta laboro esploris la ideojn de artefarita inteligento. Li elpensis programojn por ludi ŝakon kaj elektronikan muson, kiu povus solvi labirintajn problemojn. La ŝak-ludanta programo aperis en la referaĵo Programi komputilon por ludi ŝakon en 1950. Tiu propono kondukis al la unua ludo de la komputilo MANIAC ĉe Los Alamos en 1956. Tio estis la jaro, kiam Shannon aperigis referaĵon montrantan, ke universala maŝino turinga povas esti konstruita kun nur du statoj. Shannon ricevis multajn honorojn pro lia laboro.

Lewin was born in Denver, Colorado and raised in Jerusalem. He served for four years in the Israel Defence Forces as an officer in Sayeret Matkal, an elite and secretive unit. He attended the Technion university in Haifa, Israel while simultaneously working at IBM's research laboratory in Haifa. While at IBM, he was responsible for developing the Genesys system, a processor verification tool that is used widely within IBM and in other companies such as AMD and SGS-Thomson. Upon receiving a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Science, summa cum laude, in 1995, he traveled to Cambridge, Massachusetts to begin graduate studies toward a Ph.D. at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1996. While there, he and his advisor, Professor F. Thomson Leighton, came up with innovative algorithms for optimizing Internet traffic. These algorithms became the basis for Akamai, which the two founded in 1998. Lewin served as the company's Chief Technical Officer (CTO) and a board member, and during the height of the internet boom achieved great wealth. He was posthumously named one of the most influential figures of the Internet age. Lewin was killed aboard American Airlines Flight 11 during the September 11, 2001 attacks, apparently toward the beginning of the hijacking. A 2002 FAA memo suggests he may have been killed by hijacker Satam al-Suqami after he attempted to foil the hijacking. According to the FAA, Lewin was seated in business class in seat 9B, close to hijackers Mohammed Atta and Satam al Suqami (who was possibly seated behind him). It was first reported that he had been shot by al Suqami, which was later changed to being stabbed. After his death, the intersection of Main and Vassar Streets in Cambridge was renamed \"Danny Lewin Square\" in his honor.

        ns4:abstract  "Wally Feurzeig is an inventor of the LOGO programming language, and a well-known researcher in Artificial Intelligence. During the early 1960s, BBN had become a major center of computer science research and innovative applications. Wally Feurzeig joined the firm in 1962 to work with its newly available facilities in the Artificial Intelligence Department, one of the earliest AI organizations. His colleagues were actively engaged in some of the pioneering AI work in computer pattern recognition, natural language understanding, theorem proving, LISP language development and robot problem solving. Much of this work was done in collaboration with distinguished researchers at MIT such as Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy, who were regular BBN consultants during the early 1960s. Other groups at BBN were doing original work in cognitive science, instructional research and man-computer communication. Some of the first work on knowledge representation (semantic networks), question-answering, interactive graphics and computer-aided instruction was actively underway. J. C. R. Licklider was the spiritual as well as the scientific leader of much of this work, championing the cause of on-line interaction during an era when almost all computation was being done via batch processing. Wally's initial focus was on expanding the intellectual capabilities of existing teaching systems. This led to the first \"intelligent\" computer-assisted instruction (CAI) system, MENTOR, which employed production rules to support problem-solving interactions in medical diagnosis and other decision-making domains. In 1965, Wally organized the BBN Educational Technology Department to further the development of computer methods for improving learning and teaching, and the focus of his work then shifted to the investigation of programming languages as educational environments. This shift was partly due to two recent technological advances: the invention of computer time-sharing and the development of the first high-level \"conversational\" programming language. The idea of sharing a computer's cycles among autonomous users, working simultaneously, had stirred the imagination in Cambridge in 1963 and 1964. BBN and MIT teams raced to be first in realizing this concept, with BBN winning by days and holding the first successful demonstration of computer time-sharing in 1964. BBN's initial system, designed by Sheldon Boilen, supported five simultaneous users on a DEC PDP-1, all sharing a single CRT screen for output. Seeing dynamic displays from several distinct programs, simultaneously and asynchronously (\"out of time and tune\"), was a breathtaking experience. Time sharing made feasible the economic use of remote distributed terminals and opened up the possibilities of interactive computer use in schools. BBN had recently implemented TELCOMP, one of the new breed of high-level interactive programming languages. TELCOMP was a dialect of JOSS, the first \"conversational\" (i.e. , interpretive) language, developed in 1962-63 by Cliff Shaw of the Rand Corporation; its syntax was similar to that of the BASIC programming language, which had not yet appeared. Like BASIC, TELCOMP was a FORTRAN-derived language originally designed for numerical computational applications. Shortly after TELCOMP was created, Wally decided to introduce it to children as a tool for teaching mathematics and in 1965-66, under U.S. Office of Education support, explored its use as an auxiliary resource in eight elementary and secondary schools served by the BBN time-sharing system. Students were introduced to TELCOMP and then worked on standard arithmetic, algebra, and trigonometry problems by writing TELCOMP programs. The project strongly confirmed our expectation that the use of interactive computation with a high-level interpretive language would be highly motivating to students. Wally's collaborators in this research were Daniel Bobrow, Richard Grant and Cynthia Solomon from BBN and consultant Seymour Papert, who had recently arrived at MIT from Jean Piaget's Institute in Geneva. The idea of a programming language expressly designed for children arose directly from this project. The group realized that most existing languages were designed for doing computation and that they generally lacked facilities for nonnumeric symbolic manipulation. Current languages were inappropriate for education in other respects as well: they often employed extensive type declarations that got in the way of students' expressive impetus; they had serious deficiencies in control structures; their programs lacked procedural constructs; most had no facilities for dynamic definition and execution; few had well-developed and articulate debugging, diagnostic and editing facilities, so essential for educational applications."@en .

Along with other influential liberals of the period, such as Walter Lippmann, he argued that democracies needed propaganda to keep the uninformed citizenry in agreement with what the specialized class had determined was in their best interests. As he wrote in his entry on propaganda for the Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences, we must put aside \"democratic dogmatisms about men being the best judges of their own interests\" since \"men are often poor judges of their own interests, flitting from one alternative to the next without solid reason\". He is well known for his comment on communications: Who (says) What (to) Whom (in) What Channel (with) What Effect and on politics: Politics is who gets what, when, and how. and on aberrant psychological attributes of leaders in politics and business: Psychopathology and Politics Lasswell studied at the University of Chicago in the 1920s, and was highly influenced by the pragmatism taught there, especially as propounded by John Dewey and George Herbert Mead. More influential, however, was Freudian philosophy, which informed much of his analysis of propaganda and communication in general. During World War II, Lasswell held the position of Chief of the Experimental Division for the Study of War Time Communications at the Library of Congress. He analyzed Nazi propaganda films to identify mechanisms of persuasion used to secure the acquiescence and support of the German populace for Hitler and his wartime atrocities.

        ns4:abstract  "Kenneth Essex Edgeworth, DSO, MC (26 February 1880 – 10 October 1972) was an Irish astronomer, economist and engineer. He is best known for proposing the existence of a disc of icy bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune in the 1940s in much the same manner as Gerard Kuiper would publish ten years later. Observations later confirmed the existence of what has become known, somewhat controversially, as the Kuiper belt. Edgeworth was born in Streete, County Westmeath, where his uncle built an observatory. After winning a scholarship to study in Britain, he would go on to a military career as an officer with the Royal Engineers, earning decorations during World War I. He is also one of the last winners of the Pollock Medal. He returned to Ireland in the 1930s, and became both a published international economist and planetary astronomer. The asteroid 3487 Edgeworth is named in his honour."@en .

While he was walking with his nephews Milton (c. 1911–1980) and Edwin Sirotta in New Jersey's Palisades, Kasner asked them to think of good names. Milton was the one who said \"googol\". In 1940, with James Roy Newman, Kasner made a book about math called Mathematics and the Imagination ISBN 0486417034. It was in this book that the name \"googol\" was first used.

        ns4:abstract  "George Frost Kennan (February 16, 1904 – March 17, 2005) was an American advisor, diplomat, political scientist, and historian, best known as \"the father of containment\" and as a key figure in the emergence of the Cold War. He later wrote standard histories of the relations between Russia and the Western powers. In the late 1940s, his writings inspired the Truman Doctrine and the U.S. foreign policy of \"containing\" the Soviet Union, thrusting him into a lifelong role as a leading authority on the Cold War. His \"Long Telegram\" from Moscow in 1946, and the subsequent 1947 article \"The Sources of Soviet Conduct\" argued that the Soviet regime was inherently expansionist and that its influence had to be \"contained\" in areas of vital strategic importance to the United States. These texts quickly emerged as foundational texts of the Cold War, expressing the Truman administration's new anti-Soviet Union policy. Kennan also played a leading role in the development of definitive Cold War programs and institutions, most notably the Marshall Plan. Shortly after the diploma had been enshrined as official U.S. policy, Kennan began to criticize the policies that he had seemingly helped launch. By mid-1948, he was convinced that the situation in Western Europe had improved to the point where negotiations could be initiated with Moscow. The suggestion did not resonate within the Truman administration, and Kennan's influence was increasingly marginalized—particularly after Dean Acheson was appointed Secretary of State in 1949. As U.S. Cold War strategy assumed a more aggressive and militaristic tone, Kennan bemoaned what he called a misinterpretation of his thinking. In 1950, Kennan left the Department of State, except for two brief ambassadorial stints in Moscow and Yugoslavia, and became a leading realist critic of U.S. foreign policy. He continued to be a leading thinker in international affairs as a faculty member of the Institute for Advanced Study from 1956 until his death at age 101 in March 2005."@en .

Rohr is particularly known as a leading scholar of the U.S. Constitution in relationship to civil servants and public administration. One of Rohr's argument is that the Constitution pervades American society. Rohr wrote the book, Prophets Without Honor, which talked about the issue of Selective Conscientious Objection to war, detailing both the pros and cons of the possibility of such a policy. While not a Straussian in the sense of, say, Harvey Mansfield, Rohr was a student of Leo Strauss during a famous period of political theory training at the University of Chicago that heavily influenced his future work and legendary seminar teaching style."@en .

Il a reçu le prix Turing en 1985 pour ces travaux. Né de Abraham et Rose Karp à Boston, Karp a trois frères et soeurs : Robert, David et Carolyn. Il est entré à l'université Harvard, où il reçut son Bachelor's degree en 1955, son Master's degree en 1956, et son Ph.D. de mathématiques appliquées en 1959. Il a ensuite travaillé pour IBM au centre de recherche Thomas J. Watson. En 1968, il devient professeur d'informatique et de mathématiques à l'université de Californie, Berkeley, où il restera ensuite, à l'exception d'une période de 4 ans comme professeur à l'université de Washington. Richard Karp a reçu la National Medal of Science et en 2004 la médaille Benjamin Franklin en informatique pour ses travaux sur la complexité algorithmique. Il fut cité de la façon suivante lors de la remise du prix Turing : Pour ses contributions continues à la théorie des algorithmes, notamment le développement d'algorithmes efficaces pour les réseaux et d'autres problèmes d'optimisation combinatoires, l'identification de calculabilité en temps polynomial avec la notion intuitive d'algorithme efficace, et surtout, ses contributions à la théorie de la NP-complétude. Karp a introduit la méthodologie désormais classique pour prouver qu'un problème est NP-complet, ce qui a permis d'identifier de nombreux problèmes pratiques et théoriques comme étant difficiles à calculer. En 1971 il a co-developpé avec Jack Edmonds l'algorithme d'Edmonds-Karp pour résoudre le problème du flux maximum dans les réseaux, et en 1972 il a publié un article fondateur en théorie de la complexité, dans lequel il prouve la NP-complétude de 21 problèmes. En 1987, il a co-developpé l'algorithme de Rabin-Karp. Il s'intéresse actuellement à la bioinformatique."@fr , "Richard Manning Karp (born 1935) is a computer scientist and computational theorist, notable for research in the theory of algorithms, for which he received a Turing Award in 1985 and the Kyoto Prize in 2008."@en .

He is the Hugh Roy Cullen Centennial Chair in Business Administration, Professor of Information Systems, Computer Science and Economics, and Director of the Center for Research in Electronic Commerce (CREC) in the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas at Austin. Presently, he is also a Senior Research Fellow and The John Newton Centennial Fellow for the IC2 Institute. In the late 1950s, he was Sanxsay Fellow at Princeton. Prof. Whinston finished his PhD from the Carnegie Institute of Technology in 1962, at which time he also received its Alexander Henderson Award for Excellence in Economic Theory. He started work at the Yale University economics department, where he was a member of the Cowlas Foundation. He became an associate professor of economics at the University of Virginia in 1964. By 1966 he was already a full professor at Purdue University, where he became the University's inaugural Weiler Distinguished Professor of management, economics, and computer science. He began his contributions to the academic world in 1961 when he published a paper in a law journal on the topic of urban renewal. In 1962 he published his first two papers in top academic journals. The first was in the Journal of Political Economy where he showed how non-cooperative game theory could be applied to issues in micro economics. In the second paper entitled \"A Model of Multi-Period Investment under Uncertainty\" which appeared in Management Science he used non linear optimization methods to determine optimal portfolios over time. His work included innovative research advancing the concepts and practice of mathematical programming. For solving concave minimization (i.e. , global optimization) problems, he devised history's finitely convergent cutting-plane algorithm. By the early 1970s, Professor Andrew Whinston was an important contributor to the emerging discipline that is today known as Information Systems (IS), where he focused on computer-based modeling of large-scale social systems (e.g. , for pollution control) and new database techniques to handle the complex data needs of such models - with the ultimate aim of supporting decision makers. His pioneering work in the IS area of decision support systems (DSS) led to his 1981 publication of Foundations of Decision Support Systems, a classic book in the DSS research literature. In 1987, he published Business Expert Systems which was the first book to show that traditional business technologies (e.g. , involving database, spreadsheet, text, template, graphical, and solver objects) could be synergistically integrated with expert system techniques to yield practical artificially-intelligent decision support systems for business. In 1996 he was the first to publish a book on electronic commerce entitled Frontiers of Electronic Commerce; this 800 page book covered technical, social and economic issues of electronic commerce. The book had a huge impact on the Information Systems discipline throughout the world, was translated into several languages, and used as a required reading for numerous graduate programs across the country and woldwide. Almost five decades into his career, Prof. Whinston continues to produce an enormous number of groundbreaking publications. In the past three years, he has authored 30 papers which were published or accepted in top journals."@en .

        ns4:abstract  "John Muir (21 April 1838 &ndash; 24 December 1914) was a Scottish-born American naturalist, author, and early advocate of preservation of wilderness in the United States. His letters, essays, and books telling of his adventures in nature, especially in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California, have been read by millions. His activism helped to save the Yosemite Valley, Sequoia National Park and other wilderness areas. The Sierra Club, which he founded, is now one of the most important conservation organizations in the United States. One of the most well-known hiking trails in the U.S. , the 211-mile John Muir Trail, was named in his honor. Other places named in his honor are Muir Woods National Monument, Muir Beach and Muir Glacier. In his later life, Muir devoted most of his time to the preservation of the Western forests. He petitioned the U.S. Congress for the National Park Bill that was passed in 1899, establishing both Yosemite and Sequoia National Parks. Because of the spiritual quality and enthusiasm toward nature expressed in his writings, he was able to inspire readers, including presidents and congressmen, to take action to help preserve large nature areas. Muir's biographer, Steven Holmes, states that Muir has become \"one of the patron saints of twentieth-century American environmental activity,\" both political and recreational. As a result, his writings are commonly discussed in books and journals, and he is often quoted in books by nature photographers such as Ansel Adams. \"Muir has profoundly shaped the very categories through which Americans understand and envision their relationships with the natural world,\" writes Holmes. Muir was noted for being an ecological thinker, political spokesman, and religious prophet, whose writings became a personal guide into nature for countless individuals, making his name \"almost ubiquitous\" in the modern environmental consciousness. According to author William Anderson, Muir exemplified \"the archetype of our oneness with the earth.\""@en .
